# MOA (Meal Organization Application)

This application is designed to be an easy and effective way to
manage recipes, replacing the need for having an old fashioned cookbook.

Furthermore, this application has a "grocery list"-like component to it, 
allowing users to compose weekly grocery lists based on what meals they
plan to make during that week.

## Structure

The application is coded in PHP (5.6.28), using a MySQL database. The
file structure is composed as follows:

- **./classes/**   : PHP Classes
- **./db/**        : Database structure sample file
- **./public/**    : All files that are publicly visible (core HTML, JS, CSS)
- **./templates/** : All files that contain major PHP code, and are used in the other files (in ./public/)
