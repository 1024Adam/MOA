# MOA (Meal Organization Application)

This application is designed to be an easy and effective way to
manage recipes, replacing the need for having an old fashioned cookbook.

Furthermore, this application has a "grocery list"-like component to it, 
allowing users to compose weekly grocery lists based on what meals they
plan to make during the week.
